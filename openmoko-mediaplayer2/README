-- General

This is the OpenMoko media player for OM2007.2, enabling you to playback audio
(and eventually video) on your smartphone.

It stores XSPF playlists in ~/playlists and uses the SD card as media storage
by default. Please be aware that there are issues still - especially when it
comes to the user interface. They'll be fixed however, so bear with me :)

-- Theming

I tried to keep things as flexible as possible while not making structures
too nested to keep performance up. As GTK's theming abilities however are
crude at best, the following should be noted:

Button pixmap overlays are the size of the button background with one or
two pixel(s) shaved off on all four sides. I don't know why GTK requires it
but if both pixmaps have the same size it scales the background.

Also, the white button backgrounds are not symmetrical which means that the
pixmaps they contain must not be centered - which however is what GTK+ would
do. To remedy this I could either have used the button's xalign/yalign proper-
ties (which would be hard-coded in the app) or used customized pixmaps that
align with the button neatly.
I decided to use the latter option, even if it means that this prevents me
from using the stock icons from the openmoko-standard theme. I think being
more flexible is the higher good compared to having all app icons in a common
place.


If you happen to run into a bug, please use the OpenMoko bugtracker to notify
me: http://bugzilla.openmoko.org - I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Enjoy! :)
